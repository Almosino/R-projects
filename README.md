The dataset for the group project was obtained from UCI Machine Learning and is composed of 
data from two  Portuguese schools. For the purpose of the analysis, the dataset that deals
with the portuguese language and the students grades was used. More information about the dataset

the second one with mushroom and their toxicity.
